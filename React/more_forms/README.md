# Box Generator
Create a component with a form inside which accepts a color. When the form is submitted, add a box to the set of boxes with the appropriate color. You may use whichever method of styling you prefer; refer back to the end of the previous module (React Components) for more information on styling. The boxes should appear next to one another and wrap around if needed.

1. Allow the user to create/add boxes of various colors.
2. On successfully adding a new box, have it appear in the set immediately.
3. Ninja Bonus: clear out the color input on successful submission.
4. Ninja Bonus: Add a second input that takes in an integer. This integer will allow the user to specify the height and width of the generated box.
